# Sliding_Puzzle
 This is my firs projekt Sliding Puzzle.
 
 A sliding puzzle, sliding block puzzle, or sliding tile puzzle is a combination puzzle that challenges a player to slide
 pieces along certain routes to establish a certain end-configuration. 
 The pieces to be moved may consist of simple shapes, or they may be imprinted with colours, patterns, sections of a
 larger picture, numbers, or letters.
 The oldest type of sliding puzzle is the fifteen puzzle, invented by Noyes Chapman in 1880: Sam Loyd is often wrongly 
 credited with making sliding puzzles popular based on his false claim that he invented the fifteen puzzle.
