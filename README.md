# Sliding_Puzzle
 This is my firs projekt Sliding Puzzle.
 
 A sliding puzzle or fiften is a puzzle combination that chelenges the player to slide along certain paths  in order to  establish a  
 certain final configuration. The moving parts can be simple shopes tor they can be printed with colors, patterns, parts of a larger                                
 timage, numbers or letters. Sliding puzzles are essentially two-dimensional in nature. The oldest type of sliding puzzle is the  
 Fifteen puzzle, invented by Noyes Chapman in 1880: to Sam Loyd. 
   It can be shown that exactly half of all possible 20,922,789,888,000(=16!) Initial positions of the tags cannot be brought to the 
 assembled form: If we allow the box to rotate 90 degrees, in which the images of the tnumbers will be lying on their side, then we can translate the unsolvable
 tcombinations into solvable ones (and vice versa). Thus, if instead of tnumbers on the knuckles, you put dots and do not fix the position of the box,then there will be no unsolvable combinations at all.
